	      <h3>About me</h3>
	      <p>I am a senior at the University of California, San Diego. I majored in Cognitive Science with a specialization in Human Computer Interaction. I also minored in Computer Science. I love technology and innovation, the future excites me and I wanted the skillset to make my own mark on the future in this industry. I was born and raised in San Jose, California. Growing up so close to Silicon Valley definitely motivated and inspired me to enter technology. However the main reason I love technology is efficiently, I hate wasting time if there is a better way to solve a problem. Technology has been making things more efficient since the beginning of humanity</p>
